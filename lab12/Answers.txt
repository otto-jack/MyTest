A:

number    Max Chain Length
85711 		21
10^6		8
214283		15
4^5		15
400837		11
857144		9
857137		8


B:

Yes primenumbers appear to make use of more of the possible postions, making chains shorter.

C:

With wanting length 0 to occur around 1/3 of the time or less, and for most chains to be of around 1 or 2, with no more than length of 10.
When using 10^6 words, 688889 ( a prime) provided closest statistics to required.

D: 

When inserting very large lists, having a optimal number of positions is very important in the sub optimal number, it took over twice the time for words to execute. As it created very long chains, which makes the listsearch function very costly using over 65% of programs total runtime as apposed to efficient number, which used only 35% of its time on listsearch functions.
sub optimal created over 4400 length chains as opposed to the efficient which created only chains with length 20.

It also had more empty slots, 4 times the number of empty slots used by effient algorithm.
